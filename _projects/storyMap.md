# **Unveiling Coastal Vulnerability Through Interactive StoryMaps**  

As part of my work with the **iWERS research group at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of South Carolina**, I have developed an **interactive StoryMap** that explains the **importance, methodology, and findings** of our study on coastal vulnerability.  

## **Why a StoryMap?**  
While traditional research papers provide comprehensive details, they are often difficult for the general public and decision-makers to interpret. To bridge this gap, I created a **StoryMap** that presents our findings in an engaging, **interactive format**.  

### **What Youâ€™ll Find in the StoryMap**  

ðŸ”¹ **The Significance of This Study**  
- Why understanding **coastal vulnerability** is critical for **disaster preparedness and resilience**.  
- How socio-environmental factors play a key role in determining risk levels.  

ðŸ”¹ **How Vulnerability Indices Are Calculated**  
- Explanation of the **five key vulnerability categories**:  
  1. **Biophysical Vulnerability**  
  2. **Hydroclimate Vulnerability**  
  3. **Socio-Economic Vulnerability**  
  4. **Ecological Vulnerability**  
  5. **Shoreline Vulnerability**  
- Breakdown of **each contributing factor** in the vulnerability assessment.  
- Use of **multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)** and **probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA)** techniques.  

ðŸ”¹ **Interactive Vulnerability Maps**  
- Each of the five vulnerability indices is displayed in an interactive format, allowing users to explore different counties and zip codes.  
- Users can compare how different factors impact **vulnerability levels** across South Carolinaâ€™s coastal regions.  

## **Experience the StoryMap**  
The StoryMap is designed to make complex geospatial analysis **accessible and engaging** for researchers, policymakers, and the public.

This interactive tool provides a new way to **visualize and understand** coastal vulnerability, making it a valuable resource for resilience planning and environmental management.  

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
