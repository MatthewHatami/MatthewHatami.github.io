<p>I’ve always had this unstoppable curiosity that makes me explore anything and everything beyond my regular coursework. MOOCs and extracurricular courses let me dive into the skills we’re expected to know—but aren’t always taught—and I love how they fuel my passion for learning and growth.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of extracurricular courses I’ve taken, along with a short story about why and when I decided to take each one. If I earned a certificate, you’ll find it here too!</p>
