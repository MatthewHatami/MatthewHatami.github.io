**My journey has been a global adventure so far.**
I am a PhD student at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/), working in the iWERS (Intelligent Water and Environmental Resources Systems) lab within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. My current research focuses on developing a robust flood early warning system by integrating remote sensing data, including SAR and optical imagery, with on-the-ground sensors and cameras. 

Before starting my PhD program, I spent 4 months in the Netherlands at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en), within the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, as a member of the SCIO (Sustainable Cooperation, Institutions, and Organizations) cluster. This cluster focuses on researching sustainable strategies for disaster resilience. During my time in the Netherlands, I worked on developing a realistic agent-based model to simulate people's behaviors during cascading disasters.

I earned my MSc degree from the [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://polimi.it/en/) in Italy, specializing in the Civil Engineering for Risk Mitigation (CERM) program. During my Master's, I participated in various projects related to natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, and avalanches, as well as disaster risk reduction. My Master's thesis was titled 'Application of Deep Learning and Remote Sensing in Disaster Management.

My academic journey began with a BSc in Civil Engineering from the [International University of Imam Khomeini (IKIU)](https://ikiu.ac.ir/en/). During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in river hydrology and hydraulics, which sparked my fascination with floods and flood risk. This early passion laid the foundation for my subsequent research pursuits in my Master's and PhD programs, shaping my focus on disaster management and flood resilience.
