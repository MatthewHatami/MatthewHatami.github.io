<h1>Certificates</h1>

<p>I’ve always had this unstoppable curiosity that makes me explore anything and everything beyond my regular
    coursework. MOOCs and extracurricular courses let me dive into the skills we’re expected to know—but aren’t always
    taught—and I love how they fuel my passion for learning and growth.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of extracurricular courses I’ve taken, along with a short story about why and when I decided to take
    each one. If I earned a certificate, you’ll find it here too!</p>

<!-- Certificate 1 -->

        <h3>Machine Learning & GIS</h3>
        <p>This course helped me bridge the gap between machine learning and geospatial data. I took it in early 2024 as
            part of my exploration into geospatial AI.</p>

<!-- Certificate 2 -->
<div class="certificate-container reverse">
    <div class="certificate-text">
        <h3>Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs</h3>
        <p>A deep dive into Bayesian statistics, which I took in 2024 to strengthen my understanding of probabilistic
            modeling.</p>
